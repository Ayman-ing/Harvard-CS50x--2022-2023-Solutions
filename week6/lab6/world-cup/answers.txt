Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
when we take N= 100000 it values became almost the same

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 1000 simulations
